/* Heap Memory Zones
 *
 * The heap has three different zones from where memory can be allocated :-
 *
 * 1) System  Zone. Fixed size heap where alloc always succeeds and is never
 * freed. Used by any init code that will never give up the memory.
 *
 * 2) Runtime Zone. Main and larger heap zone where allocs are not guaranteed to
 * succeed. Memory can be freed here.
 *
 * 3) Buffer Zone. Largest heap zone intended for audio buffers.
 *
 * See platform/memory.h for heap size configuration and mappings.
