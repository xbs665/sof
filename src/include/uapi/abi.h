 *
 * SOF ABI versioning is based on Semantic Versioning where we have a given
 * MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version number. See https://semver.org/
 *
 * Rules for incrementing or changing version :-
 *
 * 1) Increment MAJOR version if you make incompatible API changes. MINOR and
 *    PATCH should be reset to 0.
 *
 * 2) Increment MINOR version if you add backwards compatible features or
 *    changes. PATCH should be reset to 0.
 *
 * 3) Increment PATCH version if you add backwards compatible bug fixes.
